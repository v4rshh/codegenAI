    "content": "A classic request!\n\nHere's a simple Python function that checks if a given string is a palindrome:\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns True if the input string `s` is a palindrome, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    s = s.replace(\" \", \"\").lower()  # normalize the string\n    return s == s[::-1]\n```\nLet me explain what this code does:\n\n1. The function takes a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether it's a palindrome or not.\n2. We use the `replace()` method to remove any spaces from the input string, so that we can focus on the characters themselves.\n3. We convert the entire string to lowercase using the `lower()` method, to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.\n4. Finally, we compare the original string (`s`) with its reverse (`s[::-1]`). If they match, the function returns `True`, indicating that the input string is a palindrome.\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n```python\nprint(is_palindrome(\"madam\"))  # True\nprint(is_palindrome(\"hello\"))  # False\n```\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!"
